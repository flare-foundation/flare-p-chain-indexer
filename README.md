# Flare P-chain Attestation Suite

This code implements two projects (compiled into two executables)

* P-chain clients
* Attestation client (services)

## P-chain Clients

The executable can be built with `go build indexer/main/indexer.go`.
This executable consists of several clients/cronjobs which can be enabled/disabled in the configuration file.

* P-chain indexer
* Uptime monitoring cronjob
* Voting client
* Mirroring client

### P-chain indexer

The P-chain indexer periodically reads blocks from an Avalanche-Go (Flare) node with
enabled indexing (parameter `--index-enabled` set to true) from `/ext/index/P/block` route and writes transactions and their UTXO inputs and outputs to a MySQL database.

### Uptime monitoring cronjob

The uptime monitoring cronjob periodically calls the `platform.getCurrentValidators` P-chain API route and writes all current validator node IDs thogether with "connected" flag to a MySQL database.

### Voting client

The voting client fetches all validators or delegators starting in a particular epoch from the MySQL database, creates a Merkle tree of their data hashes, and sends a vote transaction (epoch and Merkle tree root) to the voting contract.
This is done for all epoch not already processes or voted for.

### Mirroring client

Sends the data about validators in a particuler epoch to the mirror contract.

### Configuration

The configuration is read from `toml` file. Some configuration
parameters can also be configured using environment variables. See the list below.

Config file can be specified using the command line parameter `--config`, e.g., `./indexer --config config.local.toml`. The default config file name is `config.toml`.

Below is the list of configuration parameters for all clients. Clients that are not enabled can be omitted from the config file.

```toml
[db]
host = "localhost"  # MySql db address, or env variable DB_HOST
port = 3306         # MySql db port, env DB_PORT
database = "flare_indexer"    # database name, env DB_DATABASE
username = "indexeruser"      # db username, env DB_USERNAME
password = "P.a.s.s.W.O.R.D"  # db password, env DB_PASSWORD
log_queries = false  # Log db queries (for debugging)

[logger]
level = "INFO"      # valid values are: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, DPANIC, PANIC, FATAL (as in zap logger)
file = "./logs/flare-indexer.log"  # logger file
max_file_size = 10  # max file size before rotating, in MB
console = true      # also log to console

[metrics]
prometheus_address = "localhost:2112"  # expose indexer metrics to this address (empty value does not expose this endpoint)

[chain]
node_url = "http://localhost:9650/"  # node indexer address
address_hrp = "localflare"  # HRP (human readable part) of chain -- used to properly encode/decode addresses
chain_id = 162  # chain id
eth_rpc_url = "http://localhost:9650/ext/C/rpc"  # Ethereum RPC URL
api_key = ""    # API key (in case the node is protected by API key), adds ?x-apikey=... to all requests if not empty
private_key_file = "../credentials/pk.txt"  # file containing the private key of an account (for voting and mirroring clients), in hex

[p_chain_indexer]
enabled = true         # enable p-chain indexing
timeout = "1000ms"     # call avalanche p-chain indexer every ...
batch_size = 10        # batch size to fetch from the node
start_index = 0        # start indexing at this block height

[uptime_cronjob]
enabled = false         # enable uptime monitoring cronjob
timeout = "10s"         # call uptime service on every ...
enable_voting = true    # enable voting for connected validators
start = "2021-08-01T00:00:00Z"  # start of the uptime voting epoch, supports also unix timestamp as a number
period = "90s"          # length of the epoch
delay = "10"            # min delay in seconds to send the vote after the epoch ends
uptime_threshold = 0.8  # minimum uptime ratio in the epoch for a validator to be considered connected
delete_old_uptimes_epoch_threshold = 5  # delete uptimes older than this epoch

[voting_cronjob]
enabled = false          # enable voting client
timeout = "10s"          # check for new epochs every ...
first = 12345            # first epoch to vote for
delay = "10s"            # min delay in seconds to send the vote after the epoch ends

[mirroring_cronjob]
enabled = false       # enable mirroring client
timeout = "10s"       # check for new epochs every ... seconds
first = 12345         # first epoch to mirror
delay = "10s"         # min delay in seconds to send the vote after the epoch ends

[contract_addresses]
voting = "0xf956df3800379fdFA31D0A45FDD5001D02F4109c"       # voting contract address
mirroring = "0xE64Df6a7e4f4c277C5299f0FE12D7BbB8A207175"    # mirror contract address
```

### Deployment configuration

Configuration files for deployment of the voting client can be found in [docker/indexer/config_flare_voting.toml](docker/indexer/config_flare_voting.toml) (for mainnet) and [docker/indexer/config_costwo_voting.toml](docker/indexer/config_costwo_voting.toml) (for coston2). Note that database credentials and chain addresses are not included in the config files. You can use these files as a template of your own config files or use the corresponding environment variables to override the given values.

You can also use docker-compose to run the indexer. See [docker/indexer/docker-compose.yml](docker/indexer/docker-compose.yml) for an example.

Note that you normally only need to run the voting client. The mirroring client is only needed if you want to mirror the data to the mirror contract (one instance is enough for the whole network).

### Running tests

Tests for indexer expect a MySQL database running. Please run `docker-compose up` in the `indexer/resources/test` directory.

Additionally, tests for voting, mirroring and uptime clients expect a Hardhat instance from <https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts/-/tree/staking-tests> running. You start it by running
`yarn staking_test` (following `yarn` and `yarn c` commands).

## Attestation client services (possible future use)

The following services are implemented, according to the attestation specification:

* `/query`
* `/query/prepare`
* `/query/integrity`
* `/query/prepareAttestation`

The executable can be built with with `go build services/main/services.go`.

The configuration is read from `toml` file.
The settings for `[db]`, `[logger]` are the same as for the indexer above.
Specific settings are listed below.

**Note:** We recommend that the user accessing the database is not the same as for the indexer. The user for the services should only have read permissions enabled!

Config file can be specified using the command line parameter `--config`, e.g., `./services --config config.local.toml`. The default config file name is `config.toml`.

```toml
[chain]
address_hrp = "localflare"  # HRP (human readable part) of chain -- used to properly encode/decode addresses
chain_id = 162  # chain id

[services]
address = "localhost:8000"  # address and port to run the server at
```
